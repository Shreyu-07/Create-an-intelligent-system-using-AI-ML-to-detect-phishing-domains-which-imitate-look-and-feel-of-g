    <p>Phishing is a type of cybercrime that involves tricking people into providing sensitive information. The scammer poses as a legitimate institution and contacts the target by email, telephone, 
        or text message. The goal is to get the victim to visit a website that may download a virus or steal personal information.</p>

    <h2>Objective : </h2>
    <p>Creating an intelligent system to detect phishing domains that imitate genuine domains is a complex task that involves various AI and machine learning techniques. 
        Here's a high-level overview of the steps involved:</p>
    <h3>The steps are :</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Data Collection:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Gather a large dataset of known phishing and legitimate domains.
                 Include features like domain names, registration details, SSL certificates, and webpage content..</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Feature Engineering:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Extract relevant features from the dataset, such as domain length, subdomain count, special characters, 
                IP address reputation, SSL certificate issuer, and more.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Model Selection:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Choose machine learning models suitable for the task, such as Random Forest, 
                Gradient Boosting, or Deep Learning models like neural networks.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li> Labeling: </li>
        <ul>
            <li>Label the dataset to indicate whether each domain is phishing or legitimate. This requires manual or supervised labeling.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Data Preprocessing:</li>
        <ul>
            <li> Normalize and preprocess the data, handling missing values, encoding categorical features, 
                and splitting it into training and testing sets.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Model Training:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Train the selected model(s) using the labeled dataset, and tune hyperparameters for optimal performance.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Feature Importance:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Determine which features are most important for phishing detection. This helps in 
                understanding the decision-making process of the model.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Evaluation:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Assess the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, 
                F1-score, and ROC AUC on the test dataset.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Model Deployment:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Deploy the trained model as an API or service that can accept domain names as input and provide predictions.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Real-time Scanning:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Implement a system that continuously scans new domain registrations and web content.
             When a domain is flagged as suspicious, investigate further.</li>
            </ul>
        <li> Feedback Loop:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Continuously update and retrain the model with new data to adapt to evolving phishing techniques.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>User Feedback:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Allow users to report phishing attempts and use this feedback to improve the system.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Collaboration:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Collaborate with domain registrars, internet service providers, and cybersecurity organizations to share threat intelligence.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>
            Explainability:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Implement methods to make the model's decisions more interpretable, so security professionals can understand why a domain is flagged.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li> False Positive Handling:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Minimize false positives by fine-tuning the model and incorporating feedback from users and security analysts.
            </li>
        </ul>
